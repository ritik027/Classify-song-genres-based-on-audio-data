# Classify-song-genres-based-on-audio-data
Project Description
We used a dataset that comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), we trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest. We used two different algorithms to train our classifiers - decision tree, logistic regression. we first made use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors we should be aware of when doing machine learning. Next, we used the scikit-learn package to predict whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. We went over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth. We evaluated the performance of both the algoithms by using k-fold cross validation.
